EaselJSPractice
===============
These are examples that I have been working on using the CreateJS library.
So far, I have created a drag and drop program with circles in random positions and different colors.
I also created a game.js file, which just, right now shows a circle with text written inside using a container.
Last but not least, I created a graph file, which is supposed to draw a bar graph using the EaselJS library.
